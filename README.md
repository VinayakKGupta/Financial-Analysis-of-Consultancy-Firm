# **Financial-Analysis-of-Consultancy-Firm**

Analysed a financial dataset using Azure SQL and Power BI. Created SQL views to organise and reuse data logic, then built a Power BI dashboard to compare income, expenses, and budget vs actuals. This helped identify key revenue and cost drivers and supported better budgeting decisions.

## **Methodology**

Cleaning raw data in Excel -> Importing into Azure SQL -> Staging -> Data Modelling -> SQL views + procedures -> Power BI Visualisation
